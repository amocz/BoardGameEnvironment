INSTRUCTIONS
The program saves the Player name and the Player score into the gameLog.txt just before the program ends. In the next program run, if the player's username matches that of the ones in the txt, it will pull up that players saved score. If you input a name different from the txt, it will make a new entry. 

To run a game, click on 1 of the 4 button games on the menu. 
The last button is the player profile data which includes the name and the scores
